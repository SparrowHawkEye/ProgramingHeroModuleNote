# Variable Recap (18.1)

# Array (18.2~18.3)

- Array is collection of data/value.
- Array declaration example:

```
var array = ['Maksud', 'Rahman', 'Babu'];
```

- `array.length` shows no of data/ value in that `array`.
- Array index counting start from 0.
- `array.indexOf(array_data)` show the index of that `array_data`.
- Index -1 means that it is not inside the `array`.
- `array[2]` means which value/data is in index no 2 not is second position in the `array`.
- array[1] assigning it to a data/value will replace the value in index 1 with new assigned value/data.

```
array.indexOf() - to find index number.
array[Index No] - to find the value in that given index.
```

# Push and Pop in Array (18.4)

- `array.push(value)` to push a new value in the `array` at the last position.
- `array.pop(value)` to pop out a value from the `array` at the last position.
- `array.unshift(value)` to push a new value in the `array` at the first position.
- `array.shift(value)` to pop out a value from the `array` at the first position.

# Compare Variables and Comparison Operator (18.5)

-

# if else Comparison (18.6)

- if statement declaration example:

```
if(condition){
 "block of code";
} else {

 "2nd block of code";
}
```

- if `condition` is true then the code inside { } will execute. and if it is false then { } 2nd code block will execute.

# Handling Multiple Condition (18.7)

- To assign a value in a variable we use `single =` and `double =` to compare two value.
- `&& - and operator` have all the conditions need to be true to get a true result.
- `|| - or operator` have any one of the condition to be true to get a true result.

# Multi Condition and nested conditions (18.8)

- For nested condition we use

```
if(condition) {
  block of code;
} else if(condition) {
  2nd block of code;
}
"//else if continues till the last condition"
else{
  last block of code;
}
```

# Summery (18.9)
