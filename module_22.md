# Exploring string nature and reverse a string (module 22.3)

- Like `array.length` we can use `anyString.length` to get the length of the string.
- Like arrays we can use `anyString[0]` to get the first character of the string.
- string is immutable, so we can't change the value of a string. using `anyString[0]`.
- array method push,pop,shift and upshifts can't be used to add or remove elements from a string.

> used a for of loop to returns a string in reverse order.

# Handle unexpected function input parameters errors (module 22.4)

> was try to fix some errors in the code. See `JM Works/ 22_4_input_errors.js` file

# Use add and multiplication to calculate wood requirements (module 22.5)

> A function was created to calculate the wood required for a given number of furniture. where 3 parameters are passed to the function. and adding and multiplying the parameters. return total wood required. In `JM Works/22_5_add-multiply.js` file.

# Write foo, bar, foobar if divisible by 3 or 5 or both (module 22.6)

- specific and with more conditions need to use first in the if else statement. it will helps to avoid unexpected errors.

> A if else statement was created to check if the number is divisible by 3 or 5 or both. if it is divisible by 3 or 5 or both, it will return the string "foo", "bar", "foobar" respectively. In `JM Works/22_6_divisible-by.js` file.

# Find the cheapest phone from an array of phone objects (module 22.7)

- Created an array of objects.
- Created a function to find the cheapest phone. where a `for of `loop was used to iterate through the array.

> A function was created to find the cheapest phone from an array of phone objects. where the array is passed to the function. the function will return the cheapest phone object. In `JM Works/22_7_cheapest-phone.js` file.

# Calculate the total cost of the products in a shopping cart (module 22.8)

> A for of loop is done to calculate total price of the products in the shopping cart. where a array of object is used. In `JM Works/22_8_total_price.js` file.
